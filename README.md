# EARTHQUAKE-PREDICTION-MODEL-USING-PYTHON

In this section we going to provide the dependencies/package installation and contents of our project.

## 1.INTRODUCTION

We are did a project which predicts the earthquake.here we have used linear regression,support vector machine and random forest
which gives better accuracy of our model.it gives above 80% accuracy.

## 2.PREREQUISITES

List the prerequisites and dependencies for running the project. Include instructions on how to install these dependencies.
Dependencies needed:
  
  1.Numpy
  2.Pandas
  3.Seaborn
  4.Sci-kit learn
  5.Matplotlib
  6.Linear regression model
  7.SVM
  8.Random forest

Instructions to download these dependencies

### 1.Numpy:
     pip install numpy
  If you use pip, you can install NumPy 
     
   


   
### 2.Pandas
    pip install pandas    
  Pandas can be installed via pip from PyPI.
  
  
### 3.Seaborn
  Official releases of seaborn can be installed from PyPI:
  "pip install seaborn"

### 4.Sci-kit learn
    pip install scikit-learn
  Sklearn can be installed via pip from PyPI


### 5.Matplotlib
    python -m pip install -U pip
    python -m pip install -U matplotlib
  Matplotlib releases are available as wheel packages for macOS, Windows and Linux on PyPI. Install it using pip:


### 6.Linear regression model
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression"
  Here we going to import thr model only by using the sci-kit learn library
 

### 7.SVM
    "from sklearn.svm import SVR"
  Here we going to import thr model only by using the sci-kit learn library.
  
  

### 8.Random Forest
    "from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor"  
  Here we going to import thr model only by using the sci-kit learn library.
